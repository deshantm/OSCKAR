Graceful closing of interfaces and services when eventchat crashes
Eventchat recovery of still running interfaces and services
  *have them finish whatever they were doing then exit (and, a user then can
issue an osckar start/restart and they will start up again).  It would be
nice for them to try to reestablish a connection 4 or 5 times before exiting
though.  Then, we could have eventchat call an eventchat-server process,
which is the actual eventchat, and it could try restarting it if it crashes
(and keep restarting as long as it doesn't crash upon initial startup more
 than a few times), in an effort for high-availability.
