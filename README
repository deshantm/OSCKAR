OSCKAR enables individuals to design virtual appliances--self-contained 
packages of any combination of pre-existing disk images, specifications 
for on-the-fly image generation, and environmental security policies--to 
allow the secure deployment of operating systems and end user applications. 
To date, we have designed and implemented several front-ends for OSCKAR that 
demonstrate OSCKAR's extensibility and configurability (thanks to its policy 
enforcement engine and contract specification), covering use cases that 
include consolidated servers, public access terminals with kiosked operating 
systems, rapid recovery desktops, and application segregation.
